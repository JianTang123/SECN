This is a pytorch implementation of the model SECN from the paper "An Effcient Sequential Embedding ConvNet for Rotating Machinery Intelligent Fault Diagnosis".
The results are reproduced in the public code provided in the paper "Deep learning algorithms for rotating machinery intelligent diagnosis: An open source benchmark study". The code library is available at: https://github.com/ZhaoZhibin/DL-based-Intelligent-Diagnosis-Benchmark.
You are welcome to use SECN and cite it.

Example:
net = SECN(16,1,10,3,9,15,96)
